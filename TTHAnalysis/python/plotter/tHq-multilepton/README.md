# Specific instructions for the tHq analysis

#### Add the remotes for Benjamin's repository:

```
git remote add stiegerb https://github.com/stiegerb/cmgtools-lite.git -f -t tHq_80X_base
git push -u origin tHq_80X_base
```

#### [TODO]:

- Link to current set of minitrees at CERN
- Find out if we can put everything on the UNL T2 and run from there?
- Add example mca/cut/plot files
- Prepare a basic version of tHq event variable friends
