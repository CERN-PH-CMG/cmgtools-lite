N.B.: to run the whole machinery I created the script runfakerate.sh located in ${CMSSW_BASE}/src/CMGTools/MonoXAnalysis/python/plotter
This script is a wrapper of the python commands described below
To access the files on eos, the script should be run from lxplus, not pccmsrm29 or other local pc

The trees we use are the same of the signal region (we also have another set obtained with special Fake-rate triggers, but we do not use them)

The base command for electrons (you can use more options) is:
python wmass/make_fake_rates_data.py | grep python > commands4fakeRate.sh
that prints the commands to be used
grep python is just needed to select only commands that run python scripts, removing all other lines

For muons, do 
python wmass/make_fake_rates_data.py --mu | grep python > commands4fakeRate_mu.sh

Use --etaRange "<arg1>,<arg2>,...,<argN>" passing two or more numbers separated by a comma. They represent the eta bins used to compute fake rate. E.g., 0,1.479,2.1,25 uses a single bin in EB and 2 bins in EE, separated at eta=2.1.
Use --qcdmc to add QCD MC (true if --mu option is used)
Use --charge [p/n] to select positive or negative leptons (default use both)
Use --wp to select working points for numerator selection, 1 for each eta range defined by --etaRange (1 less than number of boundaries). Default is the tight one, can choose tight,medium,loose
Use --fqcd-ranges to pass the ranges for mt to be used to compute FR (4 numbers separated by commas, e.g. 0,50,70,120 will use [0,50] and [70,120]
Use --test to select the name of a folder (useful for tests, so that you leave the default directory for the final version). Plots will be put in plots/fake-rate/test/ (NB: for me 'plots' is a link to my website folders where I store all the plots)
Use --mt to select which definition of mT to use: pfmt, trkmt, pfmtfix, trkmtfix (default)
Use --pt to select which definition of pT to use: pt_coarse, pt_granular (default). Note that this is only for electrons, muons use another definition by default (to be fixed)
Use --full2016data to use full 2016 dataset (default is B to F). Luminosity is automatically set (35.5 for BtoH, 19.3 for BtoF)
Use --useSkim to run fake rate on skimmed samples in TREES_1LEP_80X_V3_FRELSKIM_V2 (currently on eos)
Use --addOpts to pass some options to add to the command (useful when you run the script from another one where you change settings). The argument is a string, use "" to enclose the command (important when you pass options with arguments, e.g. --addOpts " -A cut newcut 'var > threshold' " 


WARNING, check the ntuples you are going to use are actually present (e.g. they could be on pccmsrm29 but not on lxplus)

Then you can use pack_fake_rates_data.py, which creates the files with TH2 histogram. First argument is the output file name (give absolute path)
Options --lep-flavour is used to select electrons or muons and it is mandatory.

Use for electrons
python wmass/pack_fake_rates_data.py /afs/cern.ch/work/m/mciprian/w_mass_analysis/heppy/CMSSW_8_0_25/src/CMGTools/MonoXAnalysis/data/fakerate/FR_data_el.root --lep-flavour el

and for muons
python wmass/pack_fake_rates_data.py /afs/cern.ch/work/m/mciprian/w_mass_analysis/heppy/CMSSW_8_0_25/src/CMGTools/MonoXAnalysis/data/fakerate/FR_data_mu.root --lep-flavour mu

Use --charge [p/n] to select positive or negative leptons (default use both)
Use --wfake to use W_fake instead of QCD as MC (default is QCD)
Use --inputh-path to specify the path where root files with FR are (provide full path up to the folder containing the root file) 

REMEMBER to change some settings consistently with the pt,eta binning defined in make_fake_rates_xvars.txt. This can be done by using options --etaBinEdges and --ptBinEdges
