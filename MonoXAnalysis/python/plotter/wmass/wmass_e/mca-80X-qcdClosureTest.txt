# The option ALLOW_OVERWRITE_SETTING is needed because, when we include mca files, basically a new mca is created recursively in mcAnalysis. 
# Now, if you include a sample with some settings (for example, like FillColor) ReadMca method of mcPlots.py will complain because you 
# are trying to attach additional labels to the sample, but some where already present.
# With ALLOW_OVERWRITE_SETTINGS the error is overcome (be careful about the option you overwrite, though).
