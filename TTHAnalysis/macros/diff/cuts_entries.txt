same as above but for values >=0, mainly for pT dist.

since its for jet indices so it should have a cut at >=0

since its for delR so it should have a cut at >=0
note: of the same plot there will be other versions with different cuts. These latter cuts are on plotting level. We here quote only cuts on module level.

note how (*) makes sense. Both are gen-level entries and the major difference between them is len(QFromWFromH)==2.
